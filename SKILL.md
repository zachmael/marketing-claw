# Marketing Claw

**A pre-configured 12-agent AI marketing squad for OpenClaw.**

Marketing Claw installs a fully autonomous marketing team into your OpenClaw workspace. From daily analytics reports to newsletter drafting, social engagement, lead generation, and content scoring — your agents work around the clock so you don't have to.

## What It Does

Marketing Claw gives you 12 specialized agents, each with a distinct role, schedule, and prompt. They run on cron schedules, deliver reports to your Telegram or preferred channel, and collaborate through your shared workspace memory.

After running `node setup.mjs`, your workspace is configured with:
- Filled-in `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, and `MEMORY.md`
- 12 agent JSON configs ready to register with OpenClaw
- Playbooks for X engagement, social strategy, newsletters, and outbound leads
