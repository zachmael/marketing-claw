# Newsletter Playbook

**The complete framework for producing a consistent, high-quality newsletter.**

This playbook guides Quill's weekly drafting and serves as your editorial standard for everything that goes out under your brand's name. A great newsletter builds the most valuable audience you can own — direct, opted-in, and loyal.

## Why Newsletter Matters

Social platforms are rented. Your newsletter list is owned. When you send an email, 100% of subscribers see it in their inbox — the algorithm doesn't decide who gets it.

A well-run newsletter:
- Deepens relationships with your audience at scale
- Drives consistent traffic to content, products, and events
- Produces the highest-quality leads (people who open every week are very warm)
- Creates a feedback loop — replies and replies tell you exactly what your ICP cares about

The goal is not volume. It's loyalty. One reader who opens every issue and eventually becomes a customer is worth 100 subscribers who never engage.

## The 11-Section Structure

Every issue uses this structure. Not all sections are equally weighted — the main content block is the heart of it. Everything else serves the reader between arriving and leaving.

### Section 1: Subject Line
**The most important 60 characters you write all week.**

A great subject line:
- Creates curiosity without being clickbait
- Is specific (not "Marketing tips" but "Why your CTA is killing conversions")
- Doesn't use the word "newsletter"
- Doesn't start with your brand name
- Might feel slightly incomplete — makes them want to open to understand

Write 3 options every week. Pick the best one. A/B test them if your platform supports it.

**Formats that work:**
- The question: "Is [common belief] actually wrong?"
- The list promise: "5 things I learned shipping [X]"
- The statement: "Stop doing [thing]"
- The reveal: "The real reason [phenomenon] happens"
- The specific number: "How [company] got [specific result] in [specific time]"

**Formats that don't work:**
- Your company name in the subject line
- "This week's issue"
- Emojis as the first character (often filtered by spam algorithms)
- Vague promises: "Great stuff inside"

### Section 2: Preview Text
**The second line of copy most people see before opening.**

Should complement — not repeat — the subject line. If the subject creates curiosity, the preview should nudge it further. If the subject is a statement, the preview can be the hook that shows there's more to the story.

Max 90 characters. Don't let your platform auto-populate this — the first line of your email will be used instead, which is often "View in browser."

### Section 3: Opening Hook
**You have 3 seconds. Earn 3 more.**

The opening hook is 2–4 sentences maximum. No "welcome back" or "hope you're having a great week." Dive directly into something interesting.

Formats:
- A story opening: "Last Tuesday, I made a $[X] mistake. Here's what I learned."
- A provocative statement: "Most [role] are optimizing for the wrong metric. They don't know it yet."
- A counterintuitive fact: "The best-converting landing page I've ever seen had no hero image, no testimonials, and one sentence of copy."
- A timely observation: "Something interesting happened in [industry] this week that most people missed."

The hook should create forward momentum. After reading it, the reader should want to know what comes next.

### Section 4: This Week's Theme
**One sentence. Connects the hook to the main content.**

"This week, I'm breaking down [topic] — and why [specific aspect] matters more than most people think."

This signals to the reader what they're about to get. Think of it as the thesis statement. Optional if the hook naturally flows into the main content block.

### Section 5: Main Content Block
**The reason people subscribe.**

This is 300–600 words on this week's topic. It should be genuinely useful, interesting, or thought-provoking. Not a product pitch. Not a content summary. Something that makes the reader glad they opened.

**Formats that work well:**
- The deep dive: 600 words on one specific topic with genuine insight
- The framework: A system or approach they can apply
- The case study: What happened, what you tried, what the results were
- The contrarian take: Why conventional wisdom is wrong, with evidence
- The curated analysis: 5 things you learned from [data/experience] and what they mean

**Quality standards:**
- Every paragraph earns its place. If it doesn't add something, cut it.
- Be specific. Numbers, names, examples. Not "some companies" but "three B2B SaaS companies we worked with."
- No filler transitions. "Moving on to our next topic..." is dead weight.
- End the section with a clear conclusion or takeaway — not a summary, but a forward-looking statement.

### Section 6: What You're Consuming
**3 recommendations from you to your reader.**

Not AI-generated lists. Things you actually found valuable. Could be:
- A piece of content (article, podcast, video) with a brief note on why it's worth their time
- A tool you're using and what problem it solves
- A person worth following and why their perspective matters

Format:
> **[Type]: [Title or Resource Name]**
> [1–2 sentences on why it's worth their time]

This section builds trust because it's inherently generous. You're doing the curation work so they don't have to.

### Section 7: Industry Radar
**3 things happening in your space right now.**

Brief. Opinionated. Not just facts — your take on what it means.

Format:
> **[What happened]** — [Your 1-sentence take on why it matters]

This positions you as someone who has their finger on the pulse. Even if they already saw the news, your interpretation is the value-add.

### Section 8: Content Roundup
**Your best content from this week.**

Link to what you published (blog posts, notable social threads) with a brief description of each. One sentence per item. Links increase click-through and extend the life of your content.

Format:
> — **[Post title]** — [One-sentence tease of what's in it] → [link]

### Section 9: Community Moment
**Make them feel like they're part of something.**

Rotate between:
- A reader reply or response that's worth sharing (with permission)
- Your answer to a reader question from last week
- A question you're asking the community this week (drives replies, which boosts deliverability)
- A shoutout to a subscriber doing something worth celebrating

This section creates the sense that the newsletter is a conversation, not a broadcast. Newsletters with high reply rates get better inbox placement.

### Section 10: CTA
**One action. Not two. Not three. One.**

Every issue has one specific call to action. It should be relevant to what the issue was about. Not always a sales pitch — could be:
- "Reply and tell me [question related to this week's topic]"
- "Forward this to someone who needs to read [specific section]"
- "Try [specific thing] this week and let me know what happens"
- "Check out [specific resource] that goes deeper on today's topic"
- [Relevant product/service offer, used sparingly]

The mistake: multiple CTAs. They cancel each other out. Pick one.

### Section 11: Sign-Off
**End like a person, not a brand.**

Short. Personal. Could be:
- A teaser for next week
- A relevant quote (sparingly — avoid clichés)
- Just signing off in your natural voice

Then your name. Not "The [Brand] Team." Your name. Newsletters are personal.

## Tone Guide

**Match this to your brand voice (`{{TONE}}`), but some rules apply to all newsletters:**

- Write to one person. Not "hey everyone." Imagine your ideal subscriber sitting across from you.
- Use "you" more than "we." The reader cares about themselves, not about you.
- Short paragraphs. 3 sentences max. White space is your friend — walls of text don't get read.
- Active voice. "I tested this" not "This was tested."
- Be direct. Say what you mean. Don't hedge every sentence with "might" and "could."
- Read it aloud before sending. If you stumble, rewrite it.

**Length:** 600–1,000 words for most issues. Some topics warrant 1,200. Rarely more.

**Frequency:** Weekly is the sweet spot for most brands. More than 2x/week requires exceptional content. Less than weekly is hard to build habit around.

---

## Format Rules

- **Mobile first.** Over 60% of email opens are on mobile. Short lines, large-ish type.
- **One column.** Multi-column layouts break on mobile.
- **Minimal images.** Images slow load time and get blocked. Words are the product.
- **Alt text on every image.** Many readers have images turned off.
- **No image-only emails.** Won't load, and spam filters flag them.
- **Plain text preview.** Your newsletter should be readable in plain text if all styling fails.

---

## Deliverability Rules

Deliverability is everything. An email that doesn't reach the inbox might as well not exist.

- **Reply requests improve deliverability.** Include at least one per issue.
- **Clean your list monthly.** Remove subscribers who haven't opened in 90 days after a re-engagement attempt.
- **Authenticate your domain.** Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.
- **Never buy a list.** Purchased lists destroy your sender reputation.
- **Use a custom domain.** Never send from a @gmail or @yahoo address.
- **Watch your unsubscribe rate.** Over 0.5% per issue means something is wrong.

## Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Monday | Quill reviews Oracle brief and picks this week's main topic |
| Tuesday | Quill researches and gathers raw material |
| Wednesday | Quill drafts full issue, sends to review |
| Thursday | {{USER_NAME}} reviews, edits, personalizes |
| Thursday evening | Send |
| Friday | Check open/click rates, log in performance notes |

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Industry benchmarks (B2B/professional):**
- Open rate: 35–50% is excellent
- Click rate: 3–8% is solid
- Unsubscribe rate: Under 0.3% is healthy
- Reply rate: 0.5%+ means you're writing something people want to respond to

If your open rate is below 30%, the subject lines need work.
If your click rate is below 2%, the CTAs or content need work.
If your unsubscribe rate is above 0.5%, the content isn't matching subscriber expectations.

*Great newsletters are built one issue at a time. Consistency matters more than any single issue. Send every week, get better every week.*
