# Social Strategy Playbook

**A 5-pillar content framework for building a high-growth social presence.**

This playbook defines how to think about content strategy, what to post, when, and how to measure success. It's built to work with the Hype, Megaphone, Mingle, and Ghost agents.

## The Foundation

Great social strategy isn't about going viral. It's about building a content machine that consistently attracts the right people, builds trust with them, and converts them into customers over time.

The five pillars give you a systematic answer to "what do we post?" The weekly cadence gives structure. The growth targets give you a benchmark. The 2-week launch sequence gets you to momentum quickly.

## The 5 Content Pillars

Every piece of content should fit one of these five pillars. Each pillar serves a distinct purpose in the audience journey.

### Pillar 1: Expertise (30%)
**Purpose:** Establish credibility. Show you know your domain better than anyone.
**Audience goal:** Make your ICP think "these people get it."

Content types:
- Counterintuitive takes on common practices
- Frameworks and mental models you've built
- Deep analysis of industry data or trends
- Technical how-to's that aren't obvious
- Lessons from specific experiences (wins AND losses)

The rule: Expertise content should make someone slightly smarter or change how they think about something. If it doesn't, it's not expertise content — it's filler.

**% allocation:** ~30% of your posting cadence

### Pillar 2: Story (20%)
**Purpose:** Build connection. Show the humans behind the brand.
**Audience goal:** Make your ICP feel like they know you.

Content types:
- Specific decisions and why you made them
- Failures and what you learned
- Behind-the-scenes of how things get built
- Personal takes on where the industry is going
- Character moments that reveal values

The rule: Story content must be specific. "We failed at X and here's what happened" beats "failure is important for growth." Specificity creates connection. Vagueness creates nothing.

**% allocation:** ~20% of your posting cadence

### Pillar 3: Utility (25%)
**Purpose:** Give value. Make people's jobs/lives easier with no strings attached.
**Audience goal:** Make your ICP save or screenshot your content.

Content types:
- Step-by-step guides
- Lists of tools, resources, or tactics
- Templates or frameworks they can use
- Quick tips that produce immediate results
- Curated round-ups of the best resources in a category

The rule: Utility content should be immediately actionable. If someone can't do something with the information within 24 hours, make it more concrete.

**% allocation:** ~25% of your posting cadence

### Pillar 4: Perspective (15%)
**Purpose:** Build a point of view. Show you think differently.
**Audience goal:** Make your ICP share your content because it reflects what they believe.

Content types:
- Contrarian takes on popular opinions
- Predictions about where the industry is going
- Arguments for a specific approach vs. the mainstream
- Commentary on industry news or events
- Opinion-forward posts that take a clear side

The rule: Perspective content must be defensible. Taking a position isn't enough — you have to be able to argue for it. Avoid fake controversy (manufactured outrage) and focus on genuine intellectual disagreement.

**% allocation:** ~15% of your posting cadence

### Pillar 5: Social Proof (10%)
**Purpose:** Convert curiosity into trust. Show that what you do works.
**Audience goal:** Make your ICP believe they could achieve what your customers have achieved.

Content types:
- Customer results and case studies (with specific numbers)
- Testimonials framed around outcomes, not platitudes
- Milestones and what they mean for customers
- Before/after stories
- Community highlights

The rule: Social proof content should be about the customer, not the company. "Our customer went from X to Y" beats "we're proud to announce..." every time.

**% allocation:** ~10% of your posting cadence

## Weekly Posting Cadence Template

Adjust based on your capacity. This is the recommended starting point:

| Day | Platform | Pillar | Format | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Monday | X | Perspective | Single post or thread | Start the week with a take |
| Tuesday | X + LinkedIn | Expertise | Thread or carousel | Your best knowledge play |
| Tuesday | Blog | Expertise/Utility | Long-form post | SEO-focused |
| Wednesday | X | Story | Single post | Personal moment |
| Wednesday | Newsletter | All | Full issue | Weekly flagship content |
| Thursday | X + LinkedIn | Utility | List or how-to | Practical value |
| Thursday | Blog | Expertise/Perspective | Long-form post | Thought leadership |
| Friday | X | Social Proof | Post | End the week with evidence |

**Total per week:**
- X posts: 5 (minimum) — aim for 7 with strategic replies
- LinkedIn posts: 2
- Blog: 2
- Newsletter: 1
- Plus: 20–30 replies/comments (Mingle handles this)

## Signature Content Formats

These formats have proven track records for growth. Build your own versions and return to them consistently:

### The Retrospective Thread
**Format:** "We did X for Y months. Here's what we learned:"
Retrospectives are high-engagement because they're specific, honest, and useful. Use them quarterly for major initiatives.

### The Framework Post
**Format:** "The [N]-part framework for [topic]:"
Frameworks are highly shareable because they're organized and reusable. Create at least one original framework that {{BRAND}} can own.

### The "What Most People Miss" Post
**Format:** "Most [role] miss this about [topic]:"
Opens with the assumption that the reader has a blind spot. Creates curiosity and positions you as the one who sees what others don't.

### The Specificity Bomb
**Format:** Share a very specific result, moment, or insight with exact numbers.
"We increased [metric] from X to Y in Z weeks by doing [one thing]." Specificity is believable. Vagueness isn't.

### The Honest Take
**Format:** "Hot take / Unpopular opinion / Controversial opinion: [clear position]"
Works when the position is actually defensible and you can back it up in the thread. Don't use it for controversy's sake.

### The Story Arc
**Format:** Setup → conflict → resolution → lesson
Classic narrative structure works on social because it creates tension. The lesson must be genuinely useful, not a moral.

### The Curation List
**Format:** "The [number] best [resources/tools/tactics] for [job-to-be-done]:"
Curated lists build trust because they're inherently generous — you're doing the research so others don't have to.

## Growth Targets Framework

Set your targets based on your starting baseline. Measure weekly. Adjust monthly.

**Establish baselines in Week 1:**

| Metric | Week 1 Baseline | Month 1 Goal | Month 3 Goal |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Social followers | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Weekly follower growth | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Average post engagement rate | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| Newsletter subscribers | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Newsletter open rate | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| Blog monthly sessions | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Leads from content | ___ | ___ | ___ |

**Benchmark growth rates (adjust based on your starting size):**
- Early stage (<1K followers): 10–20% monthly growth is achievable with consistent output
- Growth stage (1K–10K followers): 5–10% monthly growth with strong content
- Scale stage (10K+ followers): 3–5% monthly growth; absolute numbers matter more than %

**The compound effect:** Focus on engagement rate over follower count early. An audience that engages well attracts more followers organically. An audience that doesn't engage makes every other metric worse.

## The 2-Week Launch Sequence

Use this when starting fresh or re-launching a social presence:

### Week 1: Establish the Foundation

**Monday:** Mission post — who you are, what you're building, who it's for. No sales pitch.

**Tuesday:** Your origin story — why you started this, the problem that drove you to it.

**Wednesday:** First expertise post — your best counterintuitive take. Something that immediately establishes credibility.

**Thursday:** First utility post — give something useful with no strings attached.

**Friday:** A genuine ask — "I'm building X for [ICP]. What's your biggest challenge with [problem]?" Not a sales ask. A listening ask.

**Daily engagement:** Reply to everyone who responds. Like and reply to 20 accounts in your ICP community.

### Week 2: Build Momentum

**Monday:** Perspective post — your take on the biggest mistake in your industry.

**Tuesday:** Thread — your best framework or system. Make it comprehensive.

**Wednesday:** Story post — a specific moment that illustrates your values.

**Thursday:** Utility roundup — your top 5–7 resources in your category.

**Friday:** First social proof post — a specific result, with permission. Even a small win with real numbers.

**Newsletter:** Send first issue at end of Week 1 or beginning of Week 2. Pull the best content from the week into it.

**Daily engagement:** Continue 20+ daily engagements. By end of Week 2, you should have 10–15 new relationships worth maintaining.
