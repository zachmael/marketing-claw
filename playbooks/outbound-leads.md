# Outbound Leads Playbook

**The complete framework for finding, scoring, and converting warm outbound leads.**

This playbook guides Hunter and Prospector. It defines who to look for, where to find them, how to score them, and how to reach out in a way that feels human — because it is.

---

## The Philosophy

The difference between good outbound and spam is one thing: timing.

Bad outbound reaches out to people who have no current reason to care. Good outbound reaches out to people who are actively experiencing the problem you solve — right now.

Your job isn't to interrupt people. It's to find the people who are already thinking about what you do, and show up at exactly the right moment with something genuinely helpful.

The agents (Hunter, Prospector, Scout) are your sensors. They're looking for signals. Your job is to interpret those signals and respond like a thoughtful human, not a sales machine.

## ICP Definition Framework

Before you can find warm leads, you need to know who you're looking for. Define your ICP precisely.

### Firmographic Profile
*(Customize these fields for your ICP)*

| Attribute | Your ICP |
|-----------|---------|
| Company type | B2B / B2C / both |
| Company stage | Startup / SMB / Mid-market / Enterprise |
| Company size (employees) | ___ |
| Revenue range | ___ |
| Industry | ___ |
| Geography | ___ |
| Tech stack signals | ___ |

### Psychographic Profile

## Signal Sources

### 1. Reddit

**Best for:** Finding people in active pain right now.

**Where to search:**
- Subreddits where your ICP hangs out (search "[industry] subreddit" to find them)
- Subreddits dedicated to your category (e.g., r/marketing, r/SaaS, r/entrepreneurship)
- Subreddits where problems adjacent to yours are discussed

**Search queries to run:**
- `"looking for [category] tool"`
- `"recommend [solution type]"`
- `"switching from [competitor]"`
- `"[competitor name] alternatives"`
- `"[pain point] help"`
- `"frustrated with [competitor]"`

**Signal strength:** High (people asking for help are actively in the market)

### 2. X / Twitter

**Best for:** Finding people with fresh buying intent and reaching them quickly.

**Search queries:**
- `"anyone use [competitor]?" OR "anyone recommend [category]?"`
- `"looking for a [solution type] that"`
- `"[competitor] is [negative adjective]"` (frustration signals)
- `"just raised" + [your industry keywords]` (companies with new budget)
- `"new [job title] at" + [company type]` (new budget holders)
- Niche hashtags used by your ICP

**Signal strength:** High for warm signals, medium for timing signals

### 3. LinkedIn

**Best for:** Identifying companies in a buying motion based on hiring patterns.

**Signals:**
- Job postings for roles that indicate they need your solution
- Companies that just hired a new [title matching your buyer persona]
- Posts in LinkedIn groups asking for recommendations
- "Looking for recommendations" posts from ICP profiles
- Company growth announcements (Series A/B, expansion, new office)

**Search queries:**
- LinkedIn Jobs: [job title that indicates buying] + [target company size/industry]
- LinkedIn People: [title] at [company type] posted in last 30 days
- LinkedIn Company: Filter by [industry + size + recent growth signals]

**Signal strength:** Medium (often shows intent before the person is actively searching)

### 4. Job Board Intelligence

**Best for:** Identifying companies investing in your category before they've decided on a solution.

**What to look for:**
- Companies hiring for a role that implies they need what you sell
- Job descriptions that mention competitor tools (shows they're already aware of the category)
- Startups hiring their first [role] — indicates they're scaling into needing tools
- Company descriptions that match your ICP profile

**Sources:** LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, Wellfound (AngelList), Lever/Greenhouse job boards, company careers pages

**Signal strength:** Medium-low (timing signal, not an active search signal)

### 5. Competitor Displacement

**Best for:** Finding people who are unhappy with your competition right now.

**Where to look:**
- G2 recent reviews (1–3 star reviews of your competitors)
- Capterra and Trustpilot reviews of competitors
- Reddit threads complaining about competitors
- X threads or comments criticizing competitor products
- LinkedIn posts where someone mentions frustration with a tool

**What to look for:**
- Specific pain points that your product addresses
- Mentions of looking for alternatives
- User frustration that's been public for less than 2 weeks (still fresh)

**Signal strength:** Very high (they're actively considering alternatives)

## Scoring Methodology

Score every lead before adding them to the pipeline. Don't waste time on low-quality signals.

### Scoring Rubric

**ICP Fit (0–3 points)**
- 3: Perfect match on company type, size, title, and industry
- 2: Strong match, one or two attributes slightly off
- 1: Partial match — right problem, wrong scale or stage
- 0: Not your ICP

**Signal Strength (0–3 points)**
- 3: Actively asking for what you do or expressing frustration with a competitor
- 2: Clear problem signal, implicit interest in your category
- 1: Timing signal only (new hire, funding) — no expressed intent
- 0: No clear signal, just an ICP profile

**Timing (0–2 points)**
- 2: Signal is less than 48 hours old
- 1: Signal is 2–7 days old
- 0: Signal is 7+ days old (not stale, but not urgent)

**Accessibility (0–2 points)**
- 2: Easy to reach with a warm opener (they're public, they've engaged with you before, or you have a mutual connection)
- 1: Reachable but will require creative outreach
- 0: Hard to reach (no public contact, private profile, no mutual)

**Total Score:**
- **8–10:** HOT — Contact within 24 hours
- **5–7:** WARM — Contact within this week
- **2–4:** NURTURE — Add to watch list, check monthly
- **0–1:** Skip

## The Multi-Touch Outreach Sequence

Once a lead is scored HOT or WARM, this is the outreach sequence:

### Touch 1: The Value-First Reply (Day 0)
Before reaching out directly, engage with them publicly first. Reply to their post with something genuinely helpful — not a pitch.

Purpose: Get on their radar. Show up as someone who knows their world. This warms the cold approach.

**Don't:** Mention your product. Don't hint at it.
**Do:** Be helpful. Answer their question. Add a useful resource. Ask a smart follow-up.

### Touch 2: The Direct Reach (Day 1–2)
Now that you've added value publicly, reach out directly.

**DM on X (for X signals):**
> Hey [name] — saw your post about [specific thing]. I've been working in this space for a while and had a thought that might be useful. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute conversation about [specific topic]? No pitch, I'm just working through some ideas and your perspective would be valuable.

**LinkedIn message (for LinkedIn signals):**
> Hi [name] — noticed you're [hiring for / building / dealing with] [signal]. I work with [ICP type] on [problem] and came across your post. We've helped companies in [similar situation] [specific result]. Worth a quick call to see if it's relevant?

**Email (if you have it):**
Subject: Re: your [post/tweet/question] about [topic]

> Hi [name],
>
> Saw your [post/question] about [specific thing]. I've spent a lot of time on this problem — [brief context on your expertise].
>
> I have a specific idea that might solve [their stated problem] faster than what most people try. Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week? I'll bring the insight regardless of whether there's any fit with what we do.
>
> [Your name]

**Rules for Touch 2:**
- Reference the specific thing they said (proves you read it)
- Lead with value, not your product
- One clear ask (15-min call, reply, yes/no)
- No attachments, no links on first contact
- No "I hope this email finds you well" — just start

### Touch 3: The Follow-Up (Day 5–7)
If no response, follow up once. Just once.

> Hi [name] — wanted to follow up on my message about [topic]. Happy to connect if timing's better — or if you've already solved this, let me know what worked. Either way useful for me.

**Rules for Touch 3:**
- Don't apologize for following up
- Don't say "just wanted to check in"
- Leave the door open but respect that no response may mean no

### Touch 4: The Long Game (Day 30)
If still no response, move them to NURTURE. Every 30 days:
- Engage with their content naturally
- If they post something relevant, reply with value
- Send 1 check-in message at the 30-day mark if there's a new relevant signal

**After 90 days of no response:** Remove from active pipeline. Keep in a cold list for quarterly check-ins only.

## The Outreach Principles

### What works:

**Specificity.** "I saw your post asking about reducing CAC for B2B SaaS companies" beats "I saw you're in marketing." The more specific, the more credible.

**Short messages.** Under 150 words for initial outreach. You're asking for attention, not their time. Earn the longer conversation.

**One ask.** Don't offer five options. Don't ask two questions. One clear ask.

**Genuine curiosity.** The best outreach sounds like you actually want to talk to this person, not just sell them something.

**Shared context.** If you have a mutual connection, mention it. If you've engaged publicly, reference it. Context reduces friction.

### What doesn't work:

**The mass blast.** If it could be sent to 1,000 people without changing a word, it shouldn't be sent at all.

**The compliment sandwich.** "Love your content! I think you'd really benefit from..." is transparent. Skip the fake compliment.

**The LinkedIn connection pitch.** Requesting a connection and immediately pitching in the acceptance message is universally despised.

**The follow-up brigade.** Following up 5 times is spam. Follow up once. Respect the silence.

**The long form.** Nobody reads a 400-word cold email. Cut it by 70%.

## Pipeline Management

Maintain the pipeline in `memory/lead-pipeline.md`. Review it weekly.

**Weekly review process:**
1. Move HOT leads that haven't been contacted to the top — why not?
2. Move WARM leads that have gone cold (7+ days without contact) to NURTURE
3. Remove leads that have converted, declined, or gone unresponsive for 30 days
4. Add new HOT and WARM leads from Hunter and Prospector output
5. Count your pipeline: set a minimum threshold (e.g., 3 HOT + 10 WARM at all times)
6. If pipeline is thin, prioritize a Prospector batch run

**Metrics to track:**
- Leads sourced per week
- Touch 1 → Touch 2 response rate
- Touch 2 → call booked rate
- Call → qualified opportunity rate
- Close rate from agent-sourced leads vs. other sources

## Competitor Displacement Framework

When you find someone frustrated with a competitor, use this framework:

**Identify:** What specific thing are they frustrated with? Pricing? Feature gap? Support? Reliability?

**Validate:** Do you actually solve this? If not, don't reach out — you'll waste both of your time.

**Lead with the pain, not your solution:**
> "Saw you mentioned [competitor issue]. That's a common frustration — [why it happens / validation]. There are a few different ways people solve this..."

Then ask if they'd like to hear how others have handled it. Don't jump to "here's why we're better." Let them ask.
