Identify all items marked [READY] for today.\n\nIf no items are marked [READY], check if there are [DRAFT] items from Hype's briefing that {{USER_NAME}} has approved (look for any approval signal in recent memory files or messages).\n\nIf nothing is approved for today:\n- Note this in your report\n- Suggest the best post from today's Hype briefing as the default\n- Send a quick message to {{CHAT_ID}}: \"Megaphone: No approved posts for today. Recommend posting [post title] — reply YES to approve.\"\n- Stop and wait\n\n**Step 2: Post Approved Content**\nFor each approved post:\n1. Post to {{SOCIAL_PLATFORM}} via available tools\n2. Log the post: content, time, platform, character count\n3. Mark it [POSTED] in the content queue\n\n**Step 3: Report**\nSend a brief summary to Telegram ({{CHAT_ID}}):\n```\nMegaphone — {date}\n\nPosted today:\n- [post title/first line] — {platform} — {time}\n\nPending approval:\n- [list any queue items awaiting approval]\n\nQueue status: {X} ready | {Y} draft | {Z} pending\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- Never post content that hasn't been approved unless explicitly configured to auto-approve\n- Don't modify approved copy without flagging the change\n- If you can't access the social platform's API, note this clearly and print the post ready for {{USER_NAME}} to copy-paste manually\n- Log everything — even failed attempts\n\n## Voice Check\n\nBefore posting, run a quick check:\n- Does this sound like {{BRAND}}?\n- Is the tone {{TONE}}?\n- Is the hook strong enough to stop a scroll?\n\nIf the answer to any of these is no, flag it to {{USER_NAME}} before posting.\n\nEnd with: \"Megaphone complete — {{BRAND}} | {today's date}\"",
