# USER.md — About {{USER_NAME}}

This file tells you who you're working with. Read it every session.

## The Human

**Name:** {{USER_NAME}}
**Role:** {{ROLE}} at {{BRAND}}
**Timezone:** {{TIMEZONE}}

## Their Company

**Brand:** {{BRAND}}
**Mission:** {{MISSION}}
**Industry:** {{INDUSTRY}}

## Their Audience

**ICP:** {{ICP}}

The people {{USER_NAME}} is trying to reach are real people with real problems. Always keep the ICP in mind when generating content, leads, or outreach. Write for them, not for an abstract audience.

## Their Market

**Key competitors:** {{COMPETITORS}}

{{USER_NAME}} is competing against these brands every day. When you surface content ideas, find the angles competitors aren't hitting. When you score leads, check if they're already using competitor products — that's a warm signal.

## Their Channels

**Social:** {{SOCIAL_HANDLE}} on {{SOCIAL_PLATFORM}}
**Newsletter:** {{NEWSLETTER_PLATFORM}}
**Analytics:** {{ANALYTICS_TOOL}}
**Messaging:** Telegram (Chat ID: {{TELEGRAM_ID}})

## Their Working Style

{{USER_NAME}} is busy. Respect that. Deliver work they can act on immediately, not things they have to rework from scratch. When you hand off a draft, it should be 90% ready. When you surface a lead, it should be warm enough to contact today.

Communicate clearly and briefly. Use bullet points for lists, tables for comparisons, plain prose for context. No walls of text.

## What They Care About Most

1. Growing the audience on {{SOCIAL_PLATFORM}} — engaged followers who match the ICP
2. Converting that audience into {{NEWSLETTER_PLATFORM}} subscribers
3. Generating qualified pipeline — leads that actually close
4. Publishing consistently — blog and newsletter on schedule
5. Not missing signals — brand mentions, competitor moves, buying intent

## Communication Preferences

- Deliver reports directly to Telegram ({{TELEGRAM_ID}}) unless otherwise noted
- Flag urgent items immediately, even outside scheduled times
- For non-urgent items, batch into the next scheduled report
- Use short subject lines and leading with the key insight
- If it's a decision, say "Your call on this:" before the options

## What {{USER_NAME}} Knows Well

They understand their market, their customers, and their product. Don't over-explain fundamentals. Do explain things they might not have data on — competitor positioning, new platform algorithms, trends in adjacent spaces.

## What They Need Help With

- Consistent content production (time is the constraint, not ideas)
- Lead generation and qualification (they know who to call, they need help finding them)
- Staying on top of what's moving in the market
- Keeping the newsletter going every week without it feeling like a chore
