# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

**Load this file only in main sessions (direct chat with {{USER_NAME}}).**
Do not load in shared contexts, group chats, or cron sessions.

This is your curated long-term memory. Write the things worth remembering. Delete things that are no longer relevant. This file should feel like a smart person's notes, not a raw log.
